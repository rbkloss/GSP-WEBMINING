 This Project's goal is to find frequent sequential patterns in web logs of access of pages.
	
 Log Example: |
 -------------|
 1 2 2 4 2 3 |
 1 3 4 |
 2 5 3 |
	
Where each line represents an user access and each column a page accessed. 

The ordering of the columns follows a temporal ordering, that is the page in column 3 was accessed before the page in column 6.

	
	
### Motivation
 The information of frequent sequential patterns can be used to help redesign the flow of information on a website, or to know where to put an advertise or a warning message that will be  seen by the majority of users or by some user archetype (found by some other method, like clusterization)
